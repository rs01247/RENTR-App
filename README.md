# RENTR - Peer to Peer Lending
# VERSION 1.0

RENTR is designed to be used for the sharing of goods, it's for people who have things that they're not using to meet up with people who need things they don't have. 

RENTR is built in React (JSX & ES6) for the front-end and Express (javascript & Jquery) to handle the back-end

To use RENTR you must register and create a profile, users will be expected to log in upon entering the site. 

The real weight of the website is in the componenets folder, that's where you'll find all of the nuts and bolts of the site. 

After logging in, users can either list an item, or view items that have already been listed. 
People will look at the items you have listed to see if they would like to rent them, and likewise, you will be looking through the items that other users have posted to see if you're interested in renting them. 

Once you have found an item that you are interested in, there is a chat feature associated with the item so you can negotiate with the owner of the item, and we have also used the Stripe API as a way of taking payment for items that are not free. 

Happy renting.

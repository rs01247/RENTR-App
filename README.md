# RENTR - Peer to Peer Lending
## VERSION 1.0

RENTR is a peer-to-peer rental service application designed to provide users a safe marketplace to rent out items that they may not need on a daily basis.

Usually, people will ask around their local circle of friends if they need to borrow something. This can range from extra chairs for a party, hand tools for a job, or camping gear to name a few.

Our platform provides users a way to reach outside of their immediate social network and connect with others who may have items they are looking to borrow.

We also strive to assure our users that the RENTR platform will be both safe and efficient.



Tools Used:
  * React
  * Express
  * SQL/Sequelize
  * Node.js
  * JWT
  * Google Maps API
  * Sendgrid API
  * Firebase
  * Stripe API



To use RENTR you must register and create a profile, users will be expected to log in upon entering the site. 

After logging in, users can either list an item, or view items that have already been listed. 

People will look at the items you have listed to see if they would like to rent them, and likewise, you will be looking through the items that other users have posted to see if you're interested in renting them. 

Once you have found an item that you are interested in, there is a chat feature associated with the item so you can negotiate with the owner of the item, and we have also used the Stripe API as a way of taking payment for items that are not free. 

A live demo of this app can be found [here](https://limitless-thicket-78191.herokuapp.com/).

Happy renting.
